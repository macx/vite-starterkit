        <p>
          Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all,
          somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. Look,
          George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that
          dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Who? Oh, uh, hey
          you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear?
          Why do you keep following me around?
        </p>

        <p>
          Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their
          own destiny. What did you say? Children. I have to tell you about the
          future. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you
          had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if
          you could go through with it? Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine
          out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is
          gonna make me change my mind. Erased from existence. Whoa, whoa, kid,
          kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who
          calls a boy is just asking for trouble.
